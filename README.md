# PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

## Chrnoic Kidney Disease Prediction - Using Machine Learning

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or chronic renal disease has become a major issue with a steady growth rate. A person can only survive without kidneys for an average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and Dialysis. It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal bias to the attributes. The research also considers the practical aspects of data collection and highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge when using machine learning for CKD status prediction.

## Machine Learning Approach to Predict the  Chronic Kidney Disease

It identifies the limitations in handling missing values when analysing CKD data, proposes a new method to handle missing values and presents the evaluation of different methods based on UCI dataset. Further, this work also highlights the importance of statistical analysis as well as the domain knowledge of the features when making a
prediction based on clinical data related to CKD.
